# iAudiobooksConv
iAudiobooksConv is an application for easily encoding your audiobooks to M4A format compatible with iOS devices.

The program has convenient UI and can convert multiple files in batch.

### Example of usage
After opening the app there is an empty state that allows you to select a file of folder with the audiobook:
![Empty home screen](./docs/Home%20(empty).png)

Then you can specify the book's title, author, and chapter titles:
![Book settings](./docs/Book%20settings.png)

Then the books queue waiting for the start of the encoding process:
![Book list](./docs/Home%20(List).png)

If you press on the convert button you'll see the next screen:
![Encoding process](./docs/Home%20(In%20process).png)

And finally after a while you'll see the result:
